# KnowYourMeme Userscripts

This is a repo for TamperMonkey/GreaseMonkey userscripts that I made for KnowYourMeme.

## Installation
First, make sure that you have a userscript addon installed.

- [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) 
- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

Then, open the raw `*.user.js` file you want to install.

If you want updates without coming here, enable it in your -monkey settings.

## Acknowledgments 

Thanks, Autumn Able, for saying *"I just want to see an actual timer for upvotes/downvotes"* which prompted me to make KnowYourVote.
